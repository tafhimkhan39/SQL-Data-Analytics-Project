# SQL-Data-Analytics-Project
---

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This project showcases my journey in applying SQL for real-world data analysis.  
The primary goal was to practice querying, analyzing, and deriving insights from datasets using SQL.  
It serves as both a portfolio project and a learning experience in data analytics fundamentals.

---

## ðŸ“– Overview

The project involves building and running SQL queries to explore, clean, and analyze datasets.  
I worked on different types of analytics tasks such as:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with SQL
- Time-based analysis (trends, changes over time)
- Segmentation and grouping of customers/products
- Cumulative metrics and window functions
- Performance analysis (top/bottom performers)

This repository is structured to demonstrate SQLâ€™s power in generating business insights and solving analytical problems.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Skills Used
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)**  
- **SQL Server / PostgreSQL** (depending on your setup)  
- **Window Functions** (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, PARTITION BY)  
- **Aggregate Functions** (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX)  
- **Joins & Subqueries**  
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**  
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**

## ðŸ“š What I Learned
Through this project, I gained experience in:
- Writing clean and efficient SQL queries.  
- Using advanced SQL functions for complex analysis.  
- Structuring queries for readability and reusability.  
- Thinking like a data analyst â€” asking the right questions and finding answers in the data.  
- Building a workflow for analyzing raw data into actionable insights.

## âš¡ Challenges I Faced
- **Schema Understanding**: Initially, I struggled with understanding how the tables related to each other and what keys connected them.  
- **Complex Queries**: Some analyses required nested subqueries and advanced window functions, which took time to master.  
- **Optimization**: Writing queries that not only worked but also ran efficiently on larger datasets.  
- **Debugging**: Handling errors when joins or aggregations didnâ€™t return the expected results.

## âœ… Conclusion
This project has been a valuable learning experience in applying SQL for analytics.  
It not only strengthened my technical query-writing skills but also improved my ability to analyze data with a problem-solving mindset.  

Working on this SQL Data Analytics Project also gave me hands-on experience with the entire process of analyzing data directly in SQL â€” from cleaning and transforming raw datasets to uncovering meaningful business insights.  
Along the way, I improved my problem-solving skills, became more comfortable with advanced SQL functions, and learned how to structure queries for clarity and performance.  

This project is more than just a collection of queries; it reflects my growth as an analyst and my ability to think critically about data. Moving forward, I plan to expand this repository by tackling larger datasets, incorporating more advanced analytics techniques, and integrating SQL outputs into visualization tools such as Tableau or Power BI to create interactive dashboards.
